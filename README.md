# OWLFUSE
A social media application for night owls

An idea that started with my capstone project known as **Owull** has evolved into a bigger idea with a new name that is spelled exactly how it sounds. 

It is a social media application for Night Owls. It will incorporate all the functionality of **Owull** in regards to the _Karaoke Lists_, _Drink Recipes_, and _Randomizer Buttons_ but also adds the ability to have a _User Profile_ complete with _user images_, _posts_, _likes and dislikes_, _comments_, _notifications_ and more.

The theme of the content involves the concept of **"Sparks"** which are the posts users create to "spark an interest" in their fellow owls. Users can "light" a spark which any user can then see on their home page in descending order of when the spark was "lit" or posted. Users then have the ability to **"Add Heat"** or **"Remove Heat"** from a spark, similar to like or dislike a post with the subtle difference that a user can gain heat. A spark with heat of 100 or more heat points becomes a **"Fire"** which can potentially become **"Infernal"** if it gains enough **Heat** and **"Stokes"**. Stokes are the comments on a post. If a Spark has turned into a Fire every new Stoke adds to the heat count as well. **Fires** that lose too many Heat points and wind up at zero are *Snuffed Out** or deleted. Sparks that go **"Infernal"** are added to the top of every user's home page in descending order of most heat points.

Notifications about Heat and Stokes come in the form of **"Sizzles"**, which is just a name that fits with the Heat theme. 

Users choose a username or "alias" as soon as they sign up and it becomes their permanent identity on OwlFuse. 

Users sign up with an email address, a password, a confirm password and their alias. Users sign in with just their email address and password. If a user forgets their password they can reset it via an email link.

A user's alias becomes their **"clozang"** as well with a closing angle bracket prepended to the beginning, all letters transformed to lowercase, and every space replaced with a dash. _for example_: "Rusty Hoppins" becomes ">rusty-hoppins". If a user's **clozang** is added to the end of **"owlfuse.com/"** it will directly link to that user's page.
